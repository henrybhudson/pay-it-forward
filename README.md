# Pay it Forward

Imagine a platform where every good deed ignites a chain reaction of generosity. We are Pay it Forward, an innovative new web app that promotes kindness, community, and charity. Our app gives users opportunities to start “chains”, where they perform an act of goodwill, and then nominate another user to follow in their footsteps. With nominations constantly being fulfilled and new chains beginning, a powerful network of generosity quickly takes shape. It's clear the world needs more kindness, and Pay it Forward is the answer we've been looking for.

## How to Use

Run `node index.js` in the `server` folder to run the server locally. Open the webpages in `client` to use the frontend interface.
